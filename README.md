# Cosinor Analysis of Circadian Gene Expression

## Overview
This repository contains R code designed for cosinor analysis, specifically tailored for circadian gene expression analysis. It is versatile enough to handle data from various sources, including luciferase reporter systems and RT-qPCR gene expression analysis.

## Features
- **Compatibility:** Works with data from both luciferase reporter systems and RT-qPCR.
- **Libraries Utilized:** Makes extensive use of `nlme` and `ggplot2` libraries for robust statistical analysis and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- R environment
- `nlme` library
- `ggplot2` library

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries (`nlme` and `ggplot2`) installed in your R environment.

### Data Import
- **Recommended Method:** Direct copy and paste from spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel).
- Data shoud be in format: 1.st row: time, replicate1, replicate2, replicate3, replicate4, replicate5
- the following rows should contain data. Please see example file: example.xlsx
- Alternatively, import data using the `data.frame` function in R.

## Usage
1. Prepare your data according to the format specified in the documentation.
2. Run the cosinor analysis script on your dataset.
3. Interpret the results using the generated plots and statistical outputs.
